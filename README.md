# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I began by using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to sketch an ERD of my data tables.

Next, I identified the primary and foreign keys, then uploaded the CSV data into the corresponding SQL table.

For my data analysis, I used a series of queries which included 'WHERE', 'INNER JOIN', and 'ORDER BY' functions, for example.
